            La Maison Simons, commonly known as Simons, is a fashion retailer in Canada, headquartered
            in Quebec City, Quebec. It is a family business currently operated by Richard and Peter Simons.
            The business was established in 1840 by the son of a Scottish immigrant to Quebec as a dry
            goods store. In the 1960s, the focus of the business changed to a department store,
            incorporating youth-oriented brands.

        <h2>Location of Simon's store (The Core) in Calgary</h2>

        <p>
            A mix of modern style and historical heritage
            Our second store to open in Alberta brought us to the very heart of Calgary, combining Simons'
            modern aesthetic with the history of one of the city's heritage buildings constructed in 1919.
            Located downtown, this five-storey store delivers a thrilling, multifaceted shopping experience
            and is a space where fashion shares the floor with art. A whimsical, large-scale mural by local
            artist Maya Gohill brings the walls to life on three floors, allowing visitors to travel through
            a colourful, one-of-a-kind world filled with magic.
